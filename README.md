# dmenu-pretty
Script for coloring dmenu according to wal colour scheme

## Use

All that needs doing is placing the script in your binaries directory and adding the line below to your i3 configs, replacing your current dmenu call.
```
  bindsym $mod+d exec ~/bin/dmenu-pretty.sh
```

Of course you can move that binary anywhere you wish so long as you adjust your configs accordingly.
